Sometimes you have no clue what happened during a historical event or why it happened. You cannot even take a guess about what variables matter. You simply know that two groups of things -- "members" and "clubs,"  for example-- are interelated in some way. You would like to have a nice 2 x 2 matrix to show these relationships in action. 

Correspondence analysis (CA) produces a 2 x 2 matrix based on relationships among two or more categories. In R, you can plot a graph that shows these relationships in action. Once seen, you can do additional research to understand the relationships in more detail.  It is therefore a powerful tool to understand historical information.

After reading this tutorial, you should:

* Know what correspondence analysis is and what it is used for.
* Have some proficiency in organizing data to conduct a correspondence analysis using R.
* Accurately describe the results of a correspondence analysis.

## Pre-requisites

This tutorial is for intermediate to advanced programming historians. It assumes you have basic understanding of R and some basic statistical knowledge (an understanding of chi-squared tests would be especially helpful).

Taryn Dewar's tutorial on [R Basics with Tabular Data](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/r-basics-with-tabular-data) has information on how to set up and configure R. Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton's tutorial on [Basic Text Processing in R](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/basic-text-processing-in-r) could be helpful as a warm-up, also.  

 Since CA is a kind of social network analysis, it likely would not hurt to look at Marten DÃ¼ring's [From Hermeneutics to Data to Networks: Data Extraction and Network Visualization of Historical Sources](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-network-diagrams-from-historical-sources) as well. 

## What is Correspondence Analysis?

Correspondence analysis (CA), also called "multi-dimensional scaling" or "bivariate network analysis" lets you observe the inter-relationship of two groups in a two-way graph plot. For example, it was famously used by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu to show how social categories like occupation influence political opinion.[^leroux] It is especially powerful as a tool for finding patterns in large datasets.

Perhaps it is easier just to show a Correspondence Analysis first.  It looks like Figure 1:

![Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Stephen Harper Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure1.png "Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Stephen Harper Government")

In it, there are two groups of objects.  One set, in blue text are FEWO, IWFA, HESA, JUST & INAN.  These are abbreviations for Parliamentary Committees.  The red group are Members of Parliament.  Committees closer together can be assumed to have more similar membership. For example, FEWO (Status of Women), INAN (Indigenous Peoples and Northern Affairs) and IWFA (Violence Against Indigenous Women) are in the same quadrant.

## Canadian Parliamentary Committees

In the Canadian Parliamentary system, citizens elect representatives called Members of Parliament or MPs to the House of Commons, where they are responsible for voting on and proposing changes to legislation in Canada. [Parliamentary Committees (CPCs)](http://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/Home) consist of MPs who inform the House about important details of policy in a topic area. Examples of such committees include the CPCs on Finance, Justice and Health.

As a historian, I suspect that Members of Parliament are organized according to committee topics differently from government to government. For example, the committees formed during Stephen Harper's Conservative government's' first cabinet must be differently organized than Justin Trudeau's Liberal initial cabinet. A number of reasons exist for this suspicion. First, CPCs are formed by party leadership and committee decisions need coordination amongs members of the House. In other words, political parties will use CPCs as tools to score political points, and governments must ensure the right people are members of the right committees to protect their political agendas. Second, the two governments have different political focus. In general, Harper's Conservative government focussed more on issues of economic development, while Trudeau's Liberals first major decisions emphasized social equality.  In short, there may be some calculated decisions about who goes into what committee, providing evidence about governmental attitudes towards or against certain topics.

## The Data

The data for this tutorial can be found in a [git repository](https://github.com/greebie/Compare/blob/master/walkcompare/data/parl_comm_minority.json).  Here is a sample of the data for the first session of Stephen Harper's government:

```
{
"INAN":{
"name": "Indigenous and Northern Affairs",
"membership":["C Warkentin", "J Crowder", "C Bennett", "S Ambler", 
"D Bevington", "R Boughen", "R Clarke", "J Genest-Jourdain", 
"J Hillyer", "C Hughes", "G Rickford", "K Seeback"]
},
"HUMA":{
"name":"Human Resources, Skills and 
Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities",
"membership": ["E Komarnicki", "C Charlton", "R Cuzner", 
"M Boutin-Sweet", "B Butt", "R Cleary", "J Daniel", 
"F Lapointe", "K Leitch", "C Mayes", "P McColeman", "D Shory"]
},
...
}

```
Structured another way (through an R table) we can show that committees have many MPs and some MPs are members of multiple committees. For example, Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett was a member of "INAN" (Indigenous and Northern Affairs) and "IWFA" (Violence against Indigenous Women) and HESA (Parliamentary Committee on Health) included both D Wilks and K Block. In general, the committees have between nine and twelve members. Some MPs are members of only one committee while others may belong to multiple committees.

When we conduct a correspondence analysis of this table, we get the nice graph you saw in Figure 1 showing the committees and MPs in relation to each other.

Now that you have seen a correspondence analysis, it is time to show how to create and interpret the findings.


## Setting Up R for Correspondence Analysis

Since the file is in json, you will need a library to convert the raw json into something that R can use. We will also need a library that will conduct the correspondence analysis for us. In R, there are a number of options, but we will use the [FactoMineR library](http://factominer.free.fr/) a library focussed on "multivariate exploratory data analysis." In regular English that means "data that happened for a number of interesting reasons and we want to use statistics to find out why."

But first, here is how to install and call the libraries then pop them into an R object for wrangling.

```R

install.packages('curl') # for grabbing the data via url
install.packages('jsonlite') # for json wrangling
install.packages('FactoMineR') # includes a module for conducting CA
install.packages('factoextra') # library to prettify our CA graphs

# import the libraries:
library(jsonlite)
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)

# get the data from the repostory and put them into objects
url_path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greebie/Compare/master/walkcompare/data/"
harper_file <- "parl_comm_minority.json"
trudeau_file <- "parliamentary_committees.json"
harper_gov <- fromJSON(paste0(url_path, harper_file)) 
trudeau_gov <- fromJSON(paste0(url_path, trudeau_file))
```

Each of the two variables are now "lists." Lists have indexes that let you select data. So, if you run: 

```R
harper_gov[1]
```

you will get the first entry for Harper's government, "INAN".

```R
$INAN
$INAN$name
[1] "Indigenous and Northern Affairs"

$INAN$membership
[1] "C Warkentin"       "J Crowder"         "C Bennett"        
[4] "S Ambler"          "D Bevington"       "R Boughen"        
[7] "R Clarke"          "J Genest-Jourdain" "J Hillyer"        
[10] "C Hughes"          "G Rickford"        "K Seeback"            
```

## A Bit of Mathematics

Now that we have the data.  Let's take a break and describe what we are going to do with it. This section will cover a bit of the math of CA.  You do not need to know this, so if mathematical explanations do not interest you, feel free to skip to the next heading! 

In order to make it easier to understand, we will begin with just a few committees. FEWO (Status of Women), HESA (Health), INAN (Indigenous and Northern Affairs), IWFA (Violence Against Indigenous Women) and JUST (Justice).

```
     C Bennett D Wilks G Rickford J Crowder K Block K Seeback L Davies N Ashton

JUST         0       1          0         0       0         1        0        0        

     R Goguen S Ambler S Truppe
FEWO        0         1        1
HESA        0         0        0
INAN        0         1        0
IWFA        1         1        1
JUST        1         0        0
```


CA is done on a "normalized" dataset [^faust] which is created by dividing the value of each cell by the square root of the product of the column and row totals, or cell $\frac{1}{\sqrt{column total \times row total}}$.  For example, the cell for FEWO and S Ambler is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3 \times 3}}$ or 0.333.

The whole "normalised" table looks like:

```
     C Bennett D Wilks G Rickford J Crowder K Block K Seeback L Davies N Ashton 
FEWO     0.000   0.000      0.000     0.000   0.000     0.000    0.000    0.408
HESA     0.000   0.408      0.000     0.000   0.408     0.000    0.408    0.000 
INAN     0.316   0.000      0.316     0.316   0.000     0.316    0.000    0.000 
IWFA     0.235   0.000      0.235     0.235   0.235     0.000    0.235    0.235 
JUST     0.000   0.408      0.000     0.000   0.000     0.408    0.000    0.000 

     R Goguen S Ambler S Truppe
FEWO    0.000    0.333    0.408
HESA    0.000    0.000    0.000
INAN    0.000    0.258    0.000
IWFA    0.235    0.192    0.235
JUST    0.408    0.000    0.000
```

The "normalisation" process does something interesting. Those who are members of multiple committees and/or who belong to committees with many members will tend to have normalisation scores that are lower, suggesting that they are more central to the network.  These members will be put closer to the centre of the matrix. For example, the cell belonging to S Ambler and IWFA has the lowest score of 0.192 because S Ambler is a member of three committees and the IWFA committee has nine members in the graph represented. 

The next stage is to find the singular value decomposition (SVD) of our "normalized" data. This involves fairly complex linear algebra that will not be covered here, but you can learn more from [this Singular Value Decomposition tutorial](http://web.mit.edu/be.400/www/SVD/Singular_Value_Decomposition.htm) or in more detail from [this pdf file on SVD](http://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). I will try to summarize what happens in lay terms.

* Two new matrices are created that show "dimension" scores for the rows (committees) and the columns (MPs) based on eigenvectors. 

* The number of dimensions is equal to the size of the columns or rows minus 1, which ever is smaller.  In this case, there are five committees compared to the MPs eleven, so the number of dimensions is 4. 

* One more matrix shows the singular values (eigenvalues), which can be used to show the influence of each dimension in the analysis.

* One of a number of "treatments" are applied to the data to make it easier to plot. The most common is the "standard coordinates" approach, which compares each normalised score positively or negatively to the mean score.

Using standard coordinates, our data tables show the following:

Each score for a "dimension" can be used as a coordinate in a graph plot. Given that we cannot visualize in four dimensions, CA outputs usually focus on the first two or three dimensions to produce a graph (for example, HESA will be plotted on \[1.245, 0.989\] or \[1.245, 0.989, 0.438] on a 3D graph) (see Figure 2).

![Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of the Stephen Harper Government, 2006](img/harper_ca_3.png "Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of the Stephen Harper Government, 2006")

"Inertia" scores are a way of showing variance in the data. Health and Justice, having the smallest membership has a high inertia score, while the most popular committee IWFA has small inertia (see figure 2). Thus, "inertia" is a way of quantifying a "distance from the centre of the graph." 

Another important score is visible on the CA graph - the percentage of explanatory value for each dimension.  This means the horizontal axis explains 42.32 percent of the variance in the graph, while the vertical axis explains almost 31 percent. What these axes mean must be interpreted based on the graph.  For instance, we might say that the left hand side represents issues concerning social identity and those on the right are more regulatory. Further historical analysis of the minutes of these committees could in turn offer greater understanding about what these members participation meant at the time.

## Correspondence Analysis of the Canadian Parliamentary Committees 2006 & 2016.

Now back to the original data. 

Starting with the Stephen Harper data, we need to create a data.frame. You can read more about mangling data in R in the [Data Wrangling and Management in R tutorial](http://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/data_wrangling_and_management_in_R), but in general a data frame makes it easy to move data around.

"lapply" tells R to run a function on every element in a list. In this case, we are telling lapply to turn each of the items in the list to a data frame using the data.frame function.  do.call(rbind ...) means to join all the data frames together to make one big dataframe. "stringsAsFactors=FALSE" tells R not to mess around with our data and just let the strings be strings.

```R
harper_df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(harper_gov, data.frame, 
    stringsAsFactors=FALSE))
```

Our data frame consists of full committee names and MP names but some of the committee names (e.g., "Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities") are too long to show well on a graph. Let's use the abbreviations instead.  We can extract these from the index of the dataframe, truncating the auto-numbering using the substr (substring) function.

```R
harper_df$abbr <- substr(rownames(harper_df), 1,4)
harper_table <- table(harper_df$abbr, harper_df$membership)
```

The 'table' command is magical.  It makes a cross-tabular dataset out of two categories in the data frame. The columns are individual MPs and rows are committees. Each cell contains a 0 or a 1 based on whether a connection exists. If we looked at actual attendence at each meeting we could also include weighted values (eg. 5 for attending a committee meeting 5 times).

Unfortunately, we have one more problem.  A large number of MPs are members of only 1 committee.  That will cause those MPs to overlap when we create the graph. Let's require MPs to belong to at least 2 committees instead, before we run FactoMineR's CA command.

```R
harper_table <- harper_table[,colSums(harper_table) > 1]
CA_harper <- CA(harper_table)
```

The CA command plots the results for the top two dimensions and stores the data summary in a variable called CA_harper. 

You should get a graph that looks something like this:

![Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Harper Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure2.png "Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Harper Government")

Let's wrangle the Trudeau government data in the exact same way.

```R
trudeau_df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(trudeau_gov, data.frame, stringsAsFactors=FALSE))
trudeau_df$abbr <- substr(rownames(trudeau_df), 1,4)]
trudeau_table <- table(trudeau_df$abbr, trudeau_df$membership)
trudeau_table <- trudeau_table[,colSums(trudeau_table) > 1]
CA_trudeau <- CA(trudeau_table)
```
![Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Justin Trudeau Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure3.png "Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Justin Trudeau Government")

Oh dear. Our data labels are not very readable right now. Even with the switch to abbreviations, the labels are overlapping.  The [factoextra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/factoextra/index.html) library has a special tool that lets us make labels repel each other to show things more clearly.

```
fviz_ca_biplot(CA_trudeau, repel=TRUE)
fviz_ca_biplot(CA_harper, repel=TRUE)
```

![Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Harper Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure4.png "Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Harper Government")

![Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Justin Trudeau Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure5.png "Correspondence analysis of Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Justin Trudeau Government")

Instead of overlapping, the labels now use arrows to show their location where appropriate.

## Interpreting the Correspondence Analysis

The data plots look nicer, but how well can we trust the validity of this data?  Our first hint is to look at the dimensions.  In the Harper data, there's only eleven and ten percent explanatory value on the horizontal and vertical axis respectively for a total of 21 percent! That does not sound promising for our analysis. Remembering that the total number of dimensions is equal to the number of rows or columns (whichever is smaller), this could be concerning.  Let's look at the data more closely:

```R 

summary(CA_Harper)
```
gives us

```

Unfortunately, the percentage of variance found in the top two dimensions is very low. Even if we were able to visualize 7 or 8 dimensions of the data, we would only capture a cumulative percentage of about 70 percent.  Has correspondence analysis failed us?  Well, not really. This just means that we cannot just throw data into an algorithm and expect to answer real history questions. But we are not just programmers but *Programming Historians*.  Let's put on our history caps and see if we can refine our research!

## Did Trudeau Expand the Agenda for Women's Equality in Parliament?

One of the early political moves Justin Trudeau made was to ensure that Canada would have a cabinet with 50% women. Arguably, the purpose of this announcement was to profess an agenda of gender equality. The Trudeau government also created a new Parliamentary Committee on equal pay for women in its first session. In addition, the Trudeau government introduced a motion to have an inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, replacing the mandate for Harper's parliamentary committee for Violence Against Indigenous Women.

If Trudeau did intend to take Women's equality seriously, we might expect that the more members of the Status of Women & Equal Pay committees would be connected to larger portfolios such as Justice, Finance, Health and Foreign Affairs compared to Harper's government. Since Harper's regime did not have an equal pay CPC, we will include the CPC for "Violence Against Indigenous Women."

```R
#include only the desired committees
# HESA: Health, JUST: Justice, FEWO: Status of Women, 
# INAN: Indigenous and Northern Affairs, FINA: Finance
# FAAE: Foreign Affairs and International Trade
# IWFA: Violence against Indigenous Women

harper_df2 <- harper_df[which(harper_df$abbr %in% 
    c("HESA", "JUST", "FEWO", "INAN", "FINA", "FAAE", "IWFA")),]
harper_table2 <- table(harper_df2$abbr, harper_df2$membership)
# remove the singles again
harper_table2 <- harper_table2[, colSums(harper_table2) > 1] 
CA_Harper2 <- CA(harper_table2)

```

This produces the graph on figure 6 (which is the exact same graph as figure 1):

![Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Stephen Harper Government](../images/correspondence-analysis-in-R/figure3.png "Correspondence analysis of selected Parliamentary Committees for 1st Session of Stephen Harper Government")

However, when we run the same analysis with the Trudeau government ...

```R
trudeau_df2 <- trudeau_df[which(trudeau_df$abbr %in% 
    c("HESA", "JUST", "FEWO", "INAN", "FINA", "FAAE", "ESPE")),]
trudeau_table2 <- table(trudeau_df2$abbr, trudeau_df2$membership)
trudeau_table2 <- trudeau_table2[, colSums(trudeau_table2) > 1] # remove the singles again
CA_trudeau2 <- CA(trudeau_table2)

```

we get ...

```R
Error in eigen(crossprod(X, X), symmetric = TRUE) : 
infinite or missing values in 'x'
```

"Infinite or missing values" suggests that there is no cross-relationship among some of the committees. Looking at trudeau_table2, we see:

```
     A Vandenbeld D Albas M Gladu R Harder S Sidhu
ESPE            1       1       1        0       1
FAAE            0       0       0        0       0
FEWO            1       0       1        1       0
FINA            0       1       0        0       0
HESA            0       0       0        1       1
INAN            0       0       0        0       0
JUST            0       0       0        0       0
```

No cross-membership for Foreign Affairs, Indigenous and Northern Affairs or Justice!  Well, that makes some sense given the nature of Violence against Indigenous Women versus Equal Pay.  Perhaps we can observe some different committees instead.  By taking out "JUST", "INAN" and "FAAE" and replacing it with "CIMM" (Immigration), "ETHI" (Ethics and Access to Information) and "HUMAN" (Human Resources) we can finally get a picture of the structure of parliamentary committees in this context.

## Analysis

As in most interpretive research, we do not get a straight-forward answer to our question about power for women in parliamentary governments.  In the Harper case, we see a division on the horizontal axis between social issues like Health & Justice and economic issues like Finance and Foreign Affairs, accounting for 35% of the variance. This result is possibly a concern because Stephen Harper's most publicized agendas tended to focus on economic concerns such as trade and fiscal restraint.

The variance on the horizontal axis is smaller for the Trudeau government, but not on social and economic terms.  Instead, there are no connections to Justice, Foreign Affairs and Indigenous Peoples, but stronger connections to Finance, Citizenship, Human Resources and Ethics. Arguably, the Harper government's regime aligned Women's Rights to social portfolios such as Justice and Health, while Trudeau connected the Status of Women to more economic concerns, raising its profile to some degree. The evidence is not strong, but the connection between committees focussed on Women's Rights and strong portfolios like Health, Finance and Citizen and Immigration in the Trudeau government is worthy of more detailed analysis. The previously held agenda between women and indigenous peoples however, has been displaced. As discussed earlier, the [National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls](https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1448633299414/1448633350146) displaced the mandate for the Violence Against Indigenous Women committee that existed during Harper's tenure. The differences between the two relationships raise important questions about the role of the Status of Women in political discourse and its interconnections among racial identity, public finance, health and social justice to be explored perhaps in more detailed qualitative work.

We could also extend the analysis to further dimensions, requiring even more complex mathematical analysis, but with the same principles.  For example, perhaps we could identify the MPs by political party, age or gender and include these into the analysis. Extending CA in this manner is called [Multiple Correspondence Analysis or MCA](http://factominer.free.fr/classical-methods/multiple-correspondence-analysis.html).  While the math is more complicated, R and the FactoMineR library continue to make the process easy.

## Conclusion

Correspondence analysis is powerful data exploration device that can be used to explore interesting topics inside data.  

Now that this tutorial is complete, you should have some sense of what correspondence analysis is and how it can be used to answer exploratory questions about data. We used R to structure the JSON data into a cross-tabular format.  Then, we ran the FactoMineR CA command to create the analysis and plot the results in two dimensions.  When the labels ran into each other, we applied the factoextra library's "viz_ca_biplot" command to display the data in a more readable format.

Hopefully, you can now apply these methods to your own data, helping you to uncover questions and hypotheses that enrich your historical research. Good luck!
