Here is what a sample lesson will look like on the `ph-submissions` site.

## Sample Header

You can make headers, and see that they show up with the same styling that a published lesson has.

Code blocks work too:

```bash
echo "hello world!"
```

I can make [absolute links as normal](http://programminghistorian.org), though if I try to make a [relative link](../lessons/counting-frequencies) to a published lesson on the Programming Historian, that won't work, because this repo will only contain lessons that are works in progress.

However, I can add images for my lesson to the images directory here on the submissions repo, and then use the standard figure syntax to include it:

{% include figure.html src="../images/sample-lesson-1.png" caption="A sample image for my sample lesson, taken from Wikipedia entry for Digital History" %}

Voila!

## Another Sample Header

Everything appears to work when I put another sample header, too. This will allow reviewers to examine a lesson and see more or less exactly what it will look like.
