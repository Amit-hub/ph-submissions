# Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data 


# Overview

In this guide, we'll show you easy methods for acquiring, hydrating, cleaning, and analyzing Twitter data.  While this walkthrough proposes a specific workflow that we think is suitable for students and researchers of all experience levels (it was originally conceived as a workshop for first-year undergraduates at Georgia Tech), we will note points in the process where other/more advanced techniques could be substituted. 

## TweetSets

First, we need to gather some data. George Washington University’s [TweetSets](https://tweetsets.library.gwu.edu/) allows you to create your own data queries from existing Twitter datasets. The datasets primarily focus on the biggest (US) geopolitical events of the last few years, but the TweetSets website states they are also open to queries regarding the construction of new datasets.  We chose TweetSets because it makes narrowing and cleaning your dataset very easy, but you could substitute any tool that gives you a set of dehydrated tweets, like Stanford’s [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) collections.  You could also work with the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/) directly, but this will require some coding.  Justin Littman, the creator of TweetSets, does a good job summarizing some of the higher-level ways of interacting with the API [here](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-09-14-twitter-data).  

We find that the graphical, web-based nature of TweetSets, however, makes it ideal for learning this process.  That said, if you want to obtain a dehydrated dataset by other means, you can just start at the “Hydrating” section.
