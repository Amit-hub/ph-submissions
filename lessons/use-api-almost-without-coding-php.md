#Scope
**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** are frequently used as a means of Open Data. Indeed, over the last years, many humanities researchers have started to share their data on the web with APIs. As a result, there are a large amount of valuable datasets available. However, APIs are often tailored for developers, and it is still not easy for the researchers who have little IT experience to work on them.

This tutorial offers the participants the possibility to **quickly learn the technology without prior knowledge of programming to start using a vast amount of data (often freely) available on the web**. In particular, it uses **Europeana API** to examine millions of cultural heritage objects from museums, libraries, and archives across Europe. Once you learn the principles, it is just a matter of time to try other APIs and take advantage of data useful for your (research) purposes. The world of Big Data is waiting for you!

#Contents and expected outcomes
The tutorial consists of two parts. The first part provides the basic theory of APIs including:
- What are APIs?
- Why are they important?
- List of useful APIs
 A practical hands-on starts in the second part with:
- Europeana API registration to get an API key
- Viewing Europeana API data on a web browser
- Installing XAMPP
- Using a local web server and creating a web page with PHP and HTML
- Developing a web page for Europeana API with PHP and HTML
- Using an API template to access Harvard Art Museum APIs
 
After the tutorial, the participants will be able to understand the basics of APIs and use them with PHP (and HTML) on a local server on their local machines. PHP is a programming language especially suited for web development, while HTML is a markup language to create webpages and applications. The participants will learn to **build their own web page** which displays API data.

Basic technology to learn:
- HTML
- PHP
- JSON

Basic concepts to learn:
- APIs
- Metadata
- Web server

#Software requirements
- Web browser (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari etc)
- XAMPP
- Text editor (Atom etc)

XAMPP creates a local web environment. It is free and includes two important packages for this tutorial: Apache web server and PHP. In this way, you can create a test website and simulate an access to APIs on your PC. 

We need a text editor for a simple programming. You can use pre-installed editors such as Notepad (Windows), but I suggest to use a free software, Atom (Mac, Windows,  Linux) which has more useful features. If you get into programming in the near future, it is a good option.
