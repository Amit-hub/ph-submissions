# Learning Goals

A substantial amount of historical data is now available in the form of raw
digitized text. Common examples include letters, newspaper articles, personal
notes, diary entries, legal documents and transcribed speeches. While some
stand-alone software applications provide tools for analyzing text data,
the flexibility of working within a programming language is eventually needed
in order to harness the full power of a corpus of text documents. In this
tutorial users are guided through the basics of text analysis within the
R programming language. Using no annotation tools more complex than a
simple tokenizer, users are shown how to:

- do exploratory analyses to check for errors and detect high-level patterns;
- apply basic stylometric methods over time and across authors;
- approach document summarization to give a high-level description of the
elements in a corpus.

All of these will be demonstrated on a real dataset from the text of every
State of the Union Addresses given by a United States President.[^2]

We assume that users have only a very basic understanding of the
R programming language. The 'R Basics with Tabular Data' article by Taryn Dewar[^1]
is an excellent guide that covers all of the assumed knowledge used here.

# A Small Example

Two R packages need to be installed before moving on through the tutorial. These
are **tidyverse** and **tokenizers**. The first provides convenient tools for reading
in and working with data sets and the second contains the functions that allow us
to split text data into words and sentences. To install these, simply start R on
our computer and run the following two lines in the console:
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tokenizers")
```
Depending on your system setup, these may open a dialog box asking you to choose a
mirror to download from. Select one near your current location and the download and
installation should be occur seamlessly. Now that these packages are downloaded to
your machine, we need to tell R that these packages should also be loaded for use.
We do this via the `library` command:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tokenizers)
```

While the `install.packages` command will only need to be run the very first time
you use this tutorial, the `library` commands must be run each and every time you
restart R.

In this section, to get started, we will work with a single paragraph of text. The
example here is a paragraph from the opening of Barack Obama's final State of the
Union address in 2016. To read this into R, you may copy and paste the following
into the R console.

```{r}
text <- paste("Now, I understand that because it's an election season",
              "expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.",
              "But, Mister Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach ",
              "that you and other leaders took at the end of last year",
              "to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working",
              "families. So I hope we can work together this year on some",
              "bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and",
              "helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse",
              "and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might surprise the",
              "cynics again")
```

After running this, typing `text` in the console and hitting enter will print out
the paragraph of text verbatim.

As a first step in processing this text, we will use the `tokenize_words` function
from the **tokenizers** package to split the text into individual words. The second
line here will print out the results to your R console window:

```{r}
tokens <- tokenize_words(text)
tokens
```

How has the R function changed the input text? It has removed all of the punctuation,
split the text into individual words, and has converted everything into lowercase
characters. We will shortly see what all of these interventions are useful in our
analysis.

How many words are there in this short snippet of text? If we use the `length` function
directly on the `tokens` object, the result is not particularly useful.

```{r}
length(tokens)
```

You should see that the length of the tokens object is equal to `1`. The reason for this
is that the function `tokenize_words` returns a list object with one entry per document
in the input. Our input only has a single document and therefore the list only has one
element. To see the words *inside* the first document, we use the symbol ``[[1]]`` to
select just the first element of the list:

```{r}
length(tokens[[1]])
```

This yields the more sensible result of `89`, indicating that there are 89 words in this
paragraph of text.

The separation of the document into individual words makes it easy to see how many times
each word was used in the text. The cleanest way of doing this is to first apply the
`table` function to the tokens in the first (and here, only) document and then to split
apart the names and values of the table into a single data frame. This, along with printing
out the result, is accomplished by the following lines of code:

```{r}
tab <- table(tokens[[1]])
tab <- data_frame(word = names(tab), count = as.numeric(tab))
tab
```

If you are new to R, or programming in general, take note that you do not need to fully
understand every minute detail of a code snippet in order to understand what the code
is ultimately trying to do. The output from this command should look like this in your
console:

```
# A tibble: 71 Ã— 2
         word count
        <chr> <dbl>
1           a     1
2       abuse     2
3     achieve     1
4       again     1
5          an     1
6         and     4
7  appreciate     1
8    approach     1
9         are     2
10         at     1
# ... with 61 more rows
```

There is a lot of information stuffed into this display. We see that there are 71 unique
words, as given by the dimensions of the table at the top. The first 10 rows of the dataset
are printed, with the second column showing how many times the word in the first column was
used. For example, "and" was used 4 times but "achieve" was used only once. A version of
this table ordered by the count variable can be seen by using the `arrange` function combined
with the `desc` function (the latter indicating that we want to sort in *desc*ending order).

```{r}
arrange(tab, desc(count))
```

The most common words are pronouns and functions words such as "and", "i", "the", and "we".
Notice how taking the lower-case version of every word helps in the analysis here. The word "We"
at the start of the sentence is not treated differently that the "we" in the middle of a
sentence.

The **tokenizer** package also supplies the function `tokenize_sentences` that splits a
text into sentences rather than words. It can be applied as follows:

```{r}
sentences <- tokenize_sentences(text)
sentences
```

Notice that the output consists of a character vector with each sentence in a separate
element. It is possible to pair the output of the sentence tokenizer with the word tokenizer.
If we pass the sentences split from the paragraph to the `tokenize_words` function, each
sentence gets treated as its own document. Apply this using the following line of code
and see whether the output looks as you would have expected it by printing the object
in the second line.

```{r}
sentence_tokens <- tokenize_words(sentences[[1]])
sentence_tokens
```

Checking the size of the output directly, you that there are four "documents" in the
object `sentence_tokens`:

```{r}
length(sentence_tokens)
```

Accessing each directly, it is possible to figure out how many words are in each sentence
of the paragraph:

```{r}
length(sentence_tokens[[1]])
length(sentence_tokens[[2]])
length(sentence_tokens[[3]])
length(sentence_tokens[[4]])
```

This can become quite cumbersome, but fortunately there is an easier way. The `sapply`
function applies its second argument to every element of its first argument. So, the following
will in one line calculate the length of every sentence in the paragraph:

```{r}
sapply(sentence_tokens, length)
```

We will see that this function is quite useful for managing larger documents.

# Analyzing Barack Obama's 2016 State of the Union Address

Let us now apply these techniques in the previous section to an entire State of the Union
address. For consistency, we will pick the same 2016 speech we had a snippet from above.
Here we will load the data in from a file as copying directly becomes too difficult at
scale. To do so, one simply combines `readLines` to read the text into R and `paste` to
combine all of the lines into a single object.[^3]

```{r}
text <- paste(readLines("sotu_text/236.txt"), collapse = "\n")
```

As before, we will tokenize the text and see how many word in total their are in the
document.

```{r}
tokens <- tokenize_words(text)
length(tokens[[1]])
```

Running this, you will see that this speech contains a total of `6113` words. Combining
the `table`, `data_frame`, and `arrange` functions exactly as done on the small example,
shows the most frequently used words in the entire speech. Notice as you run this how
easily we are able to re-use our prior code to repeat an analysis on a new set of data;
this is one of the strongest benefits of using a programming language to run a
data-based analysis.

```{r}
tab <- table(tokens[[1]])
tab <- data_frame(word = names(tab), count = as.numeric(tab))
tab <- arrange(tab, desc(count))
tab
```

Once again, extremely common words such as "the", "to", "and", and "of" float to the
top of the table. These terms are not particularly insightful for determining the
content of the speech. Instead, we want to find words that are highly represented in
this text but relatively rare over a large external corpus of English. To accomplish
this we need a dataset giving these frequencies. Here is a dataset from Peter Norvig
using the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus:[^4]

```{r}
wf <- read_csv("word_frequency.csv")
wf
```

The first column lists the language (always "en" for English in this case), the second
gives the word and the third the percentage of total words in the Trillion Word Corpus
that were equal the given word. For example, the word "for" occurs almost exactly in
1 out of every 100 words, at least for text on websites indexed by Google.

To combine these overall word frequencies with the dataset `tab` constructed from this
one State of the Union speech, the `inner_join` function may be utilized. This function
takes two data sets and combines them on all commonly named columns; in this case the
common column is the one named "word"

```{r}
tab <- inner_join(tab, wf)
tab
```

Notice that our dataset now has two extra columns giving the language (relatively
unhelpful as this is always equal to "en") and the frequency of the word over a
large external corpus. This second new column will be very helpful as we can remove
rows that have a frequency above 0.1%, that is, occurring more than once in every
1000 words.

```{r}
filter(tab, frequency < 0.1)
```

This list is starting to look a bit more interesting. A term such as "america" floats
to the top because it is use a lot in a government speech but relatively less so in
other domains. Setting the threshold even lower, to 0.002, gives an even better summary
of the speech; it will be useful to see more than the default first ten lines here, so
the `print` function along with the option `n` set to 15 is used.

```{r}
print(filter(tab, frequency < 0.002), n = 15)
```

Now, these seem to suggest the actual content of the speech with words such as "syria",
"terrorist", and "qaida" (al-qaida is split into "al" and "qaida" by the tokenizer).
We have a table giving metadata about each State of the Union speech. Let us read that
it into R now:

```{r}
metadata <- read_csv("metadata.csv")
metadata
```

For each speech we have the president, the year, the president's party, and whether the
State of the Union was giving as a speech or as a written address. The 2016 speech is
the 236th row of the metadata data, which is also the last one. It will be useful in the
next section to be able to summarize an address in just a single line of text. We can do
that here by extracting the top five most used words that have a frequency less than
0.002% in the Google Web Corpus, and combining this with the president and year.

```{r}
tab <- filter(tab, frequency < 0.002)
result <- c(metadata$president[236], metadata$year[236], tab$word[1:5])
paste(result, collapse = "; ")
```

This should give the following line as an output:

```
[1] "Barack Obama; 2016; laughter; voices; allies; harder; qaida"
```

Does this line capture everything in the speech? Of course not. Text processing will
never replace doing a close reading of a text, but it does help to give a high level
summary. This is useful in several ways. It may give a good ad-hoc title and abstract
for a document that has neither; it may serve to remind readers who have read or
listened to a speech what exactly the key points discussed were; taking many summaries
together at once may elucidate large-scale patterns that get lost over a large corpus.
It is this last application that we turn to now as we apply the techniques in this
section to the large set of State of the Union addresses.

# Analyzing Every State of the Union Address from 1790 to 2016

The first step in analyzing the entire State of the Union corpus is to read all of the
addresses into R together. This involves the same `paste` and `readLines` functions as
before, but we must put this function in a `for` loop that applies it over each of the
236 text files. These are combined using the `c` function.

```{r}
files <- sprintf("sotu_text/%03d.txt", 1:236)
text <- c()
for (f in files) {
  text <- c(text, paste(readLines(f), collapse = "\n"))
}
```

Once again calling the `tokenize_words` function, we now see the length of each address
in total number of words.

```{r}
tokens <- tokenize_words(text)
sapply(tokens, length)
```

Is there a temporal pattern to the length of addresses? How do the past several
administration's lengths compare to those of FDR, Abraham Lincoln, and George Washington?
The best way to see this is by using a scatter plot. You can construct one by using the
`qplot` function, putting the year on the x-axis and the length in words on the y-axis.

```{r}
qplot(metadata$year, sapply(tokens, length))
```

This will produce a plot similar to this one:

{% include figure.html filename="sotu-number-of-words.jpg" caption="Number of words in each State of the Union Address plotted by year." %}

It seems that for the most part addresses steadily from 1790 to around 1850, and then
increase again until the end of the 19th century. The length dramatically decreased
around World War I, with a handful of fairly large outliers scattered throughout the
20th century. Is there any rational behind these changes? Setting the color of the points
to denote whether a speech for written or delivered orally explains a large part of the
variation. The command to do this plot is only a small tweak on our other plotting command:

```{r}
qplot(metadata$year, sapply(tokens, length), color = metadata$sotu_type)
```

This yields the following plot:

{% include figure.html filename="sotu-number-of-words-and-type.jpg" caption="Number of words in each State of the Union Address plotted by year, with color denoting whether it was a written or oral message." %}

We see that the rise in the 19th Century occurred when the addresses switched to written
documents, and the dramatic drop comes when Woodrow Wilson broke tradition and gave a
his State of the Union as a speech in Congress. The outliers we saw previously were all
the post-World War II written addresses.

As a final task, we want to apply the one-line summarization function we used in the
previous section to each of the documents in this larger corpus. This again requires the
use of a for loop, but the inner code stays largely the same with the exception of needing
to save the results as an element of the vector `description`.

```{r}
description <- c()
for (i in 1:length(tokens)) {
  tab <- table(tokens[[i]])
  tab <- data_frame(word = names(tab), count = as.numeric(tab))
  tab <- arrange(tab, desc(count))
  tab <- inner_join(tab, wf)
  tab <- filter(tab, frequency < 0.002)

  result <- c(metadata$president[i], metadata$year[i], tab$word[1:5])
  description <- c(description, paste(result, collapse = "; "))
}
```

This will print out a line that says **Joining, by = "word"** as each file is processed
as a result of the `inner_join` function. As the loop may take a minute or more to run,
this is a helpful way of being sure that the code is actually processing the files as
we wait for it to run. We can see the output of this by simply typing `description`
in the console, but a slightly cleaner view is given through the use of the `cat` function.

```{r}
cat(description, sep = "\n")
```

The results yields one row for each State of the Union. Here, for example, are the
lines from the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama administrations:

```
William J. Clinton; 1993; deficit; propose; incomes; invest; decade
William J. Clinton; 1994; deficit; renew; ought; brady; cannot
William J. Clinton; 1995; ought; covenant; deficit; bureaucracy; voted
William J. Clinton; 1996; bipartisan; gangs; medicare; deficit; harder
William J. Clinton; 1997; bipartisan; cannot; balanced; nato; immigrants
William J. Clinton; 1998; bipartisan; deficit; propose; bosnia; millennium
William J. Clinton; 1999; medicare; propose; surplus; balanced; bipartisan
William J. Clinton; 2000; propose; laughter; medicare; bipartisan; prosperity
George W. Bush; 2001; medicare; courage; surplus; josefina; laughter
George W. Bush; 2002; terrorist; terrorists; allies; camps; homeland
George W. Bush; 2003; hussein; saddam; inspectors; qaida; terrorists
George W. Bush; 2004; terrorists; propose; medicare; seniors; killers
George W. Bush; 2005; terrorists; iraqis; reforms; decades; generations
George W. Bush; 2006; hopeful; offensive; retreat; terrorists; terrorist
George W. Bush; 2007; terrorists; qaida; extremists; struggle; baghdad
George W. Bush; 2008; terrorists; empower; qaida; extremists; deny
Barack Obama; 2009; deficit; afford; cannot; lending; invest
Barack Obama; 2010; deficit; laughter; afford; decade; decades
Barack Obama; 2011; deficit; republicans; democrats; laughter; afghan
Barack Obama; 2012; afford; deficit; tuition; cannot; doubling
Barack Obama; 2013; deficit; deserve; stronger; bipartisan; medicare
Barack Obama; 2014; cory; laughter; decades; diplomacy; invest
Barack Obama; 2015; laughter; childcare; democrats; rebekah; republicans
Barack Obama; 2016; laughter; voices; allies; harder; qaida
```

As before, these summaries in no way replace a careful reading of each document. They
do however serve as a great high-level summary of each presidency. We see, for example,
Bill Clinton's initial focus on the deficit in the first few years, his turn towards
bipartisanship as the House and Senate flipped towards the Republican's in the mid-1990s,
and a turn towards Medicare reform at the end of his term. George W. Bush's speeches
focus primarily on terrorism, with the exception of the 2001 speech, which occurred prior
to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Barack Obama returned the focus towards the economy in the
shadow of the recession of 2008. The word "laughter" occurs frequently because it was
added to the transcripts whenever the audience was laughing long enough to force the
speaker to pause.

# Next Steps

In this short tutorial we have explored some basic ways in which textual data may be
analyzed within the R programming language. There are several directions one can pursue
to dive further into the cutting edge techniques in text analysis. Three particularly
interesting examples are:

- running a full NLP annotation pipeline on the text to extract features such as named
entities, part of speech tags, and dependency relationship. These are available in several
R packages, including **cleanNLP**.
- fitting topic models to detect particular discourses in the corpus using packages
such as **mallet** and **topicmodels**.
- applying dimensionality reduction techniques to plot stylistic tendencies over time
or across multiple authors. For example, the package **tsne** performs a powerful
form of dimensionality reduction particularly amenable to insightful plots.

Many generic tutorials exist for all three of these, as well as extensive package
documentation. We hope to offer tutorials particularly focused on historical applications
on these in the near future.
